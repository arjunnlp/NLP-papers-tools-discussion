Anything useful goes here


## Welcome to the arjunnlp.github.io Wiki. NLP related stuff that can be of use goes here.

### Possible research directions, other than what we already do:

[The 4 Biggest Open Problems in NLP Today](http://ruder.io/4-biggest-open-problems-in-nlp/)

### SOTA

### New Libraries

[Flair - LM/Embedding/General NLP lib. Fastest growing NLP project on github](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair)

### Visualization Software

### Other useful tools

### Paper and Technical Writing HOWTO

On writing research papers:

["How to Write an Introduction" by Dr. Om Gnawali](http://www2.cs.uh.edu/~gnawali/courses/cosc6321-s17/hw7.html)

Some of the best examples of technical writing (papers & blogs go hand in hand!):

[How to trick a neural network into thinking a panda is a vulture](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/five/why-do-neural-networks-think-a-panda-is-a-vulture)

[Picking an optimizer for Style Transfer](https://blog.slavv.com/picking-an-optimizer-for-style-transfer-86e7b8cba84b)

[How do we 'train' Neural Networks?](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-do-we-train-neural-networks-edd985562b73)

### Must-read papers
[Deep Graph Methods Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00596.pdf)

[Disciplined Training of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09820)
